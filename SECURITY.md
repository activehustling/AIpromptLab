### **5. If a Vulnerability is Accepted or Declined**

* **Accepted:** If validated, we will fix the issue and may publicly credit you (if you wish) for responsible disclosure.
* **Declined:** If the issue is not considered a security risk or is a known limitation, we will provide a clear explanation of why it was declined.

Regardless of the outcome, you will be notified of the final decision.



### **6. Responsible Disclosure Guidelines**

We ask that you:

* Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or accessing data that doesn‚Äôt belong to you.
* Refrain from actions that could disrupt or damage systems or services.
* Give us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before sharing it publicly.

We greatly appreciate researchers and users who help us maintain security through responsible disclosure.
